### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a curious software engineer who loves to code in an idiomatic code style. I have a special interest in Java and Kotlin. I have been interacting with Java for the last 5 years now on a personal level. My work experience with Java and Kotlin has taught me that the code i write or approve has to be as maintainable and as readable as can be possible to make it adaptable in future. I love new challenges and to break them down into smaller bits that i can tick off. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on testing the microservices i created at:  https://github.com/tushark-16bit/books-service-entrypoint
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m looking to learn more about architecture and software design patterns that may interact with functional programming as well as OOP.
- I am looking to learn more about serverless programming and am open to talk/ interact about the subject
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email me at kal.tushar16@gmail.com

Also, i love to read, and a few of Books i would recommend to any fellow programmer would be:
- Deep Work by Cal Newport (I have observed i work better in focused sessions, and this may introduce you to the idea)
- What if by Randall Munroe(Just for the fun of it)
- The evergreen 'The Pragmatic Programmer', 20th anniversary version which has been updated for modern needs
